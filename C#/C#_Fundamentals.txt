Title:
    C# Fundamentals by Scott Allen

Description:
    This course gives you everything you need to become a productive C# developer on any platform.
    Learn the basics of reading and writing C# code in your own applications.

Relevant topics that it covers:
    C# Syntax
    Classes and Object
    Testing C# Code
    Work with Reference Types and Value Types
    Controlling the Flow of Execution
    Building Types
    Object-oriented Programming with C#

My Review:
    Scott Allen's course was a fantastic introduction to C#. It took things down a notch, or up depending on perspective,
    and starting with explaining the basics of programming. Variable declaration, Objects, if statements, conditions, TDD.
    But he did so with the intention of explaining the logic behind it e.g. he explains the difference between value and Reference
    types, how to see what type a given datatype is and how you as the developer should approach using them. I really enjoyed this
    course, following along and gleaning some of the insights that Scott Allen could fit into this course.
